The \"nipperkins\" were a pair of handled cups which the children supposed to be silver, and which they always used at table.\\nDotty knew she was doing wrong every time she played \"King and Queen.\" She knew the milk was not hers, but Mrs. Gray\\'s; still she said to herself, \"Ruthie needn\\'t give so much measure, all pressed down and run over. If Queenie and I should drink a great deal more, there would always be a quart left. Yes, I know there would.\"\\nMrs. Gray never said anything about the milk; she merely poured it out in a pan, and gave back the pail to Dotty, asking her at the same time as many questions as the child would stay to hear.',\n",
