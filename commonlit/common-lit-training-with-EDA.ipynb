They are called marsh marigolds.\\nFlies hide in the flowers. They soak up the Sun’s energy and get warm.\\nThe flies fly from flower to flower.

       "7406  When you think of dinosaurs and where they lived, what do you picture? Do you see hot, horny swamps, thick jungles, or sunny plains? Dinosaurs lived in those places, yes. But did you know that some dinosaurs lived in the cold and the darkness near the North and South Poles?\\nThis surprised scientists, too. Paleontologists used to believe that dinosaurs lived only in the warmest parts of the world. They thought that dinosaurs could only have lived in places where turtles, crocodiles, and snakes live today.

Patty and Roger were playing against Elise and Sam Blaney, and the pairs were well matched.\\nBut the long-contested victory finally went against Patty, and she laughingly accepted defeat.\\n\"Only because Patty's not quite back on her game yet,\" Roger defended; \"this child has been on the sick list, you know, Sam, and she isn't up to her own mark.\"\\n\"We...
